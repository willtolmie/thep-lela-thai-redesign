            The first is the default state of the pop-up, the second occurs when a mouse hovers over the "YES, REMOVE THIS ITEM" button and the third occurs when the "YES, REMOVE THIS ITEM" button has been selected using the keyboard. 
        </div>
                to evaluate the learnability, memorability, efficiency and accessibility of these components, we must look at them in every possible direction. in the context of digital interfaces, this looks like analyzing the inputs users can effect and resulting outputs users can experience when interacting with these components.
        <h3>part 1: input</h3>
       
        the functionality of each of these components differs based on (mode of)
        input, <br />as shown in the following table
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>ASK</th>
            <th>lululemon</th>
            <th>TikTok Shop</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>mouse or touchpad</td>
            <td>
              • hovering over the ‘Cancel’ button makes the button turn gray<br />
              • the ‘OK’ button does not change colors when the mouse hovers
              over it
            </td>
            <td>
              • hovering over the ‘Yes, remove this item’ button makes the
              button turn into a darker red<br />• the line under ‘No, keep this
              item’ turns red when the mouse hovers over it
            </td>
            <td></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>keyboard</td>
            <td>
              • hitting the ‘Enter’ button activates the ‘OK’ button<br />•

            </td>
            <td>
              • hitting the ‘Enter’ button activates the ‘Yes, remove this item’
              button<br />• hitting the ‘esc’ button removes the window and
              changes nothing
            </td>
            <td></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>touch</td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
            <td>
              • the only tappable elements are the ‘Shop now,’ ‘Terms apply,’
              and ‘x’ buttons<br />• the ‘Shop now’ and ‘x’ buttons do the same
              thing
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <h3>part 2: output</h3>
        while inputs change the internal state of a component, outputs are a
        representation of these changes in state. <br />outputs help to reveal
        the purpose of and current accessibility considerations for a component,
        <br />as shown in the following table
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>ASK</th>
            <th>lululemon</th>
            <th>TikTok Shop</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>screen reader</td>
            <td>
              • the screen reader reads the text located above the buttons and
              automatically selects the ‘OK’ button, reading the title of the
              button and then ‘You are currently on a Button. to click this
              button, press control-option-space.’ <br />• the user can use the
              arrow keys to modify which button the screen reader reads,
              pressing left to switch to the ‘Cancel’ button.
            </td>
            <td>
              • the screen reader reads the text located above the buttons and
              automatically selects the ‘Yes, remove this item’ button, reading
              the title of the button and then ‘You are currently on a Button.
              to click this button, press control-option-space.
              <br />
              • the user cannot use the arrow keys to switch which button the
              screen reader reads.
            </td>
            <td>
              • the screen reader reads the buttons and makes playful noises
              when switching between buttons.
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <h3>part 3: state models</h3>
        using these observations about potential interactions with and
        accessibility considerations for the pop-up windows, <br />we can create
        state models to visualize how a user may interact with the lululemon
        pop-up window
        <div>
          <h4>
            mouse & keyboard state models for the lululemon pop-up window as it
            currently exists
          </h4>
          <img class="stateImage" src="./assets/State Models.jpg" />
        </div>
        we can make changes to these models to maximize the pop-up window's
        learnability, memorability, efficiency and/or accessibility across
        multiple forms of input
        <div>
          <h4>
            revised mouse & keyboard state models for the lululemon pop-up
            window
          </h4>
          <img class="stateImage" src="./assets/Revised State Models.jpg" />
        </div>
        using these revised state models, we can make improvements to the
        lululemon pop-up window
        <div>
          <h4>revised lululemon pop-up window in the "default" state</h4>
          <img class="figmaImage" src="./assets/normal.png" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>revised lululemon pop-up window in the "focused" state</h4>
          <img class="figmaImage" src="./assets/focused.png" />
        </div>
        <h3>part 5: reflection</h3>
        <div class="reflection">
          • the components I observed were generally successful in
          usability/accessibility because they had hover states for mouse users.
          these color changes help users be aware of the location of their mouse
          and therefore understand interactions. I kept these in my final design
          because I want to maximize accessibility and usability for users.
        </div>
        <div class="reflection">
          • the components I observed also had support for screen readers, which
          read button labels and provided instructions for interaction for
          accessibility. I wanted to maintain this accessibility in my final
          design as well.
        </div>
        <div class="reflection">
          • the original design of the lululemon pop-up lacked contextual
          information. adding this information enhances users’ decision-making
          ability and therefore solves the previous mismatch in design which may
          have prompted users to make the wrong decision.
        </div>
        <div class="reflection">
          • I also believe the unequal button spacing made navigation less
          intuitive, so I changed them to occupy equal space and clearly appear
          as interactive elements, improving learnability and efficiency.
        </div>
        <div class="reflection">
          • my changes also strengthened accessibility for keyboard users,
          ensuring that all users have an equitable experience.
        </div>
        <div class="reflection">
          • the added item image and descriptive text provide more context,
          reducing uncertainty for visually impaired users who may have not
          known which item they chose to remove in the first place.
        </div>
        <div class="reflection">
          • I think the consistent button sizes and placement improve usability
          for users with cognitive impairments by reducing the cognitive load
          required to make the keep/remove decision.
        </div>
        <div class="reflection">
          • I think mouse and touch interactions are prioritized in UI design,
          often at the expense of keyboard and screen reader users. I can work
          towards a more inclusive and efficient user experience for all by
          including keyboard users and screen reader interactions in my design.
